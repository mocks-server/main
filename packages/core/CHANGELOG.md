## [unreleased]

### Added
- feat: Add `mock.collections.toPlainObject()` method

### Changed
- chore(deps): Update dependencies
- refactor: Do not require namespaces to have a name when creating scaffold, because config 2.0.0 do not return root namespace.
- feat(BREAKING CHANGE): Do not return server instance on start method. Now, the server instance is returned only on the constructor.
- feat: Return delay and type as null in plain routes when they are disabled
- feat(BREAKING CHANGE): Return always an array of methods in routes plain objects get with the `mock.routes.plain` getter

### Fixed
- fix: Remove error handling in `server.listen` method. According to the node docs, the callback is never called with an error. Instead, the error is emitted on the server object.
- fix: Catch possible errors when file loaders process files synchronously
- fix: Support any type of JSON object as body in JSON variant handler
- fix: Return null in preview of static variant handler
- fix: When an id was duplicated in a route variant, all variants were ignored in the `plain` getter, even when the route was created. Now, only the duplicated variant is ignored.
- fix: Display proper alerts path in logs when an alert is added

### Deprecated
- feat: Deprecate `mock.collections.plain` getter. Use `mock.collections.toPlainObject()` instead
- feat: Deprecate `mock.routes.plain` getter. Use `mock.routes.toPlainObject()` instead

- feat: Remove default route handler. Now the `type` property is mandatory in variants
- feat: Do not support `handler` property in variants, which was an alias for `type`. From now, only `type` is supported (and required, unless disabled property is true)

## [3.11.0] - 2022-08-25

### Added
- feat: Support asynchronies in files. Files now can export a function. In that case, the loader will receive the result of the function. If function returns a promise, it will receive the result of the promise once it is resolved (rejected promises are treated as file load errors).
- Added: Support null value in "from" property in collections

### Changed

- chore(deps): Update @mocks-server/config to 1.3.0

- feat(#337): Add "static" Variant Handler
- feat: Support defining routes without method. In that case, the route will handle all HTTP methods
- feat: Support method "*" in routes. In that case, the route will handle all HTTP methods.
- feat: Add "disabled" property to variants. When it is true and the variant is selected, the route will be disabled.

- Files handler now supports creating fixtures or behaviors at any folder level.
- Files handler now supports files exporting a single behavior or fixture.
- Changed "Behaviors" getters. Data now is not parsed, and returns directly fixtures collections, or, in the case of "all" getter, it returns and object containing behavior names as "keys", containing respective fixtures collections. (It is not considered as a breaking change, as it is an experimental interface yet, as it is indicated in the documentation)
- Change settings automatically to first found behavior if no one is defined.
- Improve start, init and stop server methods. Now support multiple concurrent calls.
- tracer.set method "transport" argument now is passed as second argument. Default value is "console".
- Change "boom" dependency. Now "@hapi/boom" is used.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-12-07
### Changed
- "path" option has "mocks" value by default. The server will create path if it does not exist.

### Fixed
- Fix server started log. Was always printing localhost, without taking into account custom "host" option.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-11-29
### Added
- Emit new load:files event.
- Listen to programmatic change of port and host settings for restarting the server.
- Allow "register" property in plugins, which will be called during plugins registration process.

### Changed
- Migrate core from [@mocks-server/main, v1.3.0](https://github.com/mocks-server/main/releases/tag/v1.3.0). For further info read the [previous repository CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mocks-server/main/blob/v1.3.0/CHANGELOG.md#130---2019-11-17)
- Export core, which can be used only programmatically. (Binary is distributed in the [@mocks-server/main](https://github.com/mocks-server/main) package).
- Remove admin-api and inquirer-cli. Both are now plugins with their own repositories.

### Fixed
- Stop files watcher when `stop` method is called.
